# Neural_Network_Charity_Analysis

## Objective
The objective of this project is helping Bek building the predicted model where the model has capability of predicting whether applicants to "Alphabet Soupâ€™s organization" will be successful if funded by them.

The tool we are using in this analysis is machine learning and neural networks toghether with CSV data file which containing more than 34,000 organizations that have received funding from Alphabet Soup over the years

## Preprocessing Data for a Neural Network Model

The data set we have is raw data with numperous of missing, and unusable values. We have to perform a clean up in order to be apply machine learning Neural Network Model for the analysis. After cleaning up we were able to put them into new data frame and are ready for use. Dataframe is shown as below :

## Compile, Train, and Evaluate the Model

## Optimize the Model
